## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular architecture, with separate files and directories for different functional components like music playback, database operations, pagination menu, help menu, etc. The codebase uses object-oriented programming principles and design patterns, such as inheritance and composition, to achieve separation of concerns and modularity.                                                |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The codebase relies on external libraries and systems like Discord API, Lavalink for music playback, MySQL for database storage, and various Python libraries like aiohttp, asyncio for asynchronous operations. These dependencies are crucial for the system's functionality and integration with other services.                            |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The system demonstrates good modularity by organizing functionalities into separate files and folders with clear roles, such as music controls, database operations, pagination menu, help menu, etc. This modular design allows for easy extensibility, maintenance, and code reuse.                                                                                                         |
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**      | The performance of the system can vary based on factors like the server's hardware resources, network connection, and data volume. However, the asynchronous nature of the codebase, the use of efficient algorithms, and the integration with external services like Lavalink help ensure efficient resource usage and minimal bottlenecks in music playback and data operations. |
| **üîê Security**        | Security measures are expected to be implemented for protecting sensitive data like tokens, database credentials, and ensuring valid user access to the Discord bot and its functionalities. Safeguarding against SQL injection vulnerabilities is also crucial to maintain the system's security. Implementing authorization and updates to follow best practices can reinforce the security measures.      |
| **üì∂ Scalability**     | The system's scalability depends on factors like server capacity, network infrastructure, and efficient utilization of resources. The codebase follows mod

Contributions are always welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the project repository. This creates a copy of the project on your account that you can modify without affecting the original project.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using a Git client like Git or GitHub Desktop.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-feature-branch` or `bugfix-issue-123`).
```sh
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```
4. Make changes to the project's codebase.
5. Commit your changes to your local branch with a clear commit message that explains the changes you've made.
```sh
git commit -m 'Implemented new feature.'
```
6. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command
```sh
git push origin new-feature-branch
```
7. Create a new pull request to the original project repository. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made and why they're necessary.
The project maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback or merge them into the main branch.
